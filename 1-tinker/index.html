            <strong>"The Face Of Love"</strong>
                    
            I've seen your face on stained glass, in colored lights
            In pictures of you looking to the sky
            You've been portrayed a thousand different ways
            But my heart can see you better than my eyes
            'Cause it's love that paints the portrait of your life
                    
            [Chorus:]
            The face of love
            The face of love
            You look more like love every day
                    
            I've read your words in the pages of your life
            And I've imagined what you were like
            I may not know the shape of your face
            But I can feel your heart changing mine
            And your love still proves that you're alive
                    
            [Chorus:]
                    
            You are the face that changed the whole world
            No one too lost for you to love
            No one too low for you to serve
            So give us the grace to change the world
            No one too lost for me to love
                    
            No one too low for me to serve
                    
            Let us see... let us be your face
                    
            [Chorus:]
